# Bilingual Generation
## Helping children with bilingualism in their bones stay connected to heritage languages and culture.

Bilingual Generation is working to empower families and educators with the tools to help kids with bilingualism in their bones maintain a meaningful connection with their heritage languages. We develop culturally-affirming programs, curricula, and resources that celebrate multilingualism. Our approach is rooted in the science of learning and focused on the core of bilingualism: connection.
