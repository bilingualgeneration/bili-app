## Design Philosophy

Since we're a small team with limited resources, our guiding principle is to do the most with the least changes. To accomplish that, we should follow these guidelines

1. Where possible, use an existing component, whether from a framework (eg Ionic) or an already built custom component (eg Input)
2. If needed, make changes to custom components to expand their use cases
3. If needed, make app-wide changes to style in an existing `scss` file; try not to create any new `scss` files
4. If the previous guidelines cannot be followed, ping the team for discussion before taking further action
